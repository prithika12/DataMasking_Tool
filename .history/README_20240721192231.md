# Data Masking Tool

This project is a simple web application that allows users to upload an Excel file, mask sensitive attributes based on specific criteria, and download the modified file. The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.

## Features

- Upload two Excel files: one containing metadata and another containing data values.
- Mask data values in the data file if the metadata file classifies the attribute as sensitive (Confidential, Restricted, or Protected).
- Download the modified Excel file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x 
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-masking-tool.git
    cd data-masking-tool
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install flask pandas openpyxl
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Upload your Excel file and click on "Upload and Mask Data".

4. Download the modified Excel file with masked data values.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Files**: The user uploads two Excel files:
   - Metadata file: Contains multiple columns, including `attribute_name` and `termInstance`.
   - Data file: Contains data values under each attribute name.

2. **Process Files**: The application reads both files. It identifies which attributes should be masked based on the `termInstance` column in the metadata file.

3. **Mask Data**: The application masks data values in the data file for attributes classified as Confidential, Restricted, or Protected.

4. **Download Modified File**: The modified Excel file gets automatically downloaded with the masked data values.
